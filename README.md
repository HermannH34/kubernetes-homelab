**A declarative, semi-production Kubernetes cluster managed entirely through GitOps principles**


</div>

---

## 🎯 What is this?

This is a **Kubernetes homelab cluster** implementing production-grade tools and 
practices in a pre-production environment. Managed with industry-standard DevOps 
practices, every configuration is version-controlled, every secret is encrypted, 
and every deployment is automated.

**The Goal?** To demonstrate hands-on expertise with cloud-native technologies while self-hosting useful applications and learning by doing.

## 🛤️ The Journey

This homelab started with **K3d** for local development, then moved to **VPS servers** (4-core, 8GB RAM) for a more realistic setup. Currently hosted in the **bare metal Cloud** while I'm relocating to Canada 🇨🇦, but the plan is to eventually run it on **Raspberry Pi hardware** once settled—because there's something special about managing physical infrastructure.
