# kubernetes-homelab

## Introduction
This repo contains all of the configuration and documentation of my homelab.

The purpose of my homelab is to learn and have fun. As a software engineer, Iâ€™ve learned DevOps. My homelab is where I experiment and discover new things in Kubernetes and GitOps. Additionally, by self-hosting applications, I take full responsibility for the entire process of deploying and maintaining them from A to Z. It forces me to think about security, the ease of deployment and maintenance.
